<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This inside-out grilled cheese is a crispy, crunchy, cheesy masterpiece. In my humble opinion, it is the ultimate grilled cheese sandwhich.
    Make sure you follow some basic rules for this to work properly. Only use airy, nutritionally insignificant white bread. Be sure to use a nice
    sharp Cheddar and a quality nonstick pan over medium to medium-low heat.
