<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This inside-out grilled cheese is a crispy, crunchy, cheesy masterpiece. In my
  humble opinion, it is the ultimate grilled cheese sandwhich. Make sure you
  follow some basic rules for this to work properly. Only use airy,
  nutritionally insignificant white bread. Be sure to use a nice sharp Cheddar
  and a quality nonstick pan over medium to medium-low heat.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
  <li>2 slices white bread</li>
  <li>1/2 cup shredded extra sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low
    heat. Place bread slices over hot butter in the skillet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Spread about 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese on 1 bread slice; place other bread
    slice, butter side up, on top of cheese. Spread about 2 tablespoons cheese
    on top of sandwich.
  </li>
  <li>
    Melt remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter in the skillet next to sandwich. Flip
    sandwich onto melted butter, cheese-side down. Spread remaining cheese on
    top of sandwich. Cook until cheese on the bottom is crispy and caramelized,
    3 to 4 minutes. Flip sandwich and cook until cheese is crispy and
    caramelized on the other side, 3 to 4 minutes more.
  </li>
</ol>
